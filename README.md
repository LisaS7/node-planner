This is my first node app. It displays a calendar which can be populated with tasks for the week.

How It Works
The app runs using a node.js Express server. The calendar grid is generated using JavaScript.

Configuration
Weekdays and times can be changed in the script.js file.

Todo:
- Create config file for days and times.

// <%- include('../partials/tasks', {tasks: tasks}); %>
