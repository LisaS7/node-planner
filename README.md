This is my first node app and my first encounter with MongoDB. The app displays a calendar which can be populated with tasks for the week.

How It Works
The app runs using a node.js Express server and the data is stored in MongoDB. The calendar grid is generated using JavaScript.

What I learned

- node.js
- Express
- ejs template engine
- MongoDB
