This is my first node app. It displays a calendar which can be populated with tasks for the week.

How It Works
The app runs using a node.js Express server. The calendar grid is generated using JavaScript.

Configuration
Weekdays and times can be changed in the config.json file.

What I learned
- node.js
- Express
- ejs template engine
- MongoDB
